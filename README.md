# Image clustering with Python 3

Generalizing image with Autoencoder and clustering with DBScan based on density

This is prepared for 3 different images to find their similarities

DBScan choosen because clusters created without knowing number of clusters

### Variational autoencoder (VAE)

VAE is used for generalizing images
